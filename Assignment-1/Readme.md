ASSIGNMENT #1
=============

---

Directions
----------

Create a web application that allows you to manage a list of students.  You should have 3 files that you are working on

- **Student.cs** - the object that holds information on each student
- **MainPage.cs.aspx** - the web control page that allows you to add web controls and HTML
- **MainPage.cs** - The code behind the MainPage.cs.aspx where you will add functionality to your program


Part 1
------


Write a C# Web Application that provides the user with an option to do the following: 

- Add a student
- Delete a student
- Modify a student
- Find a student with ID only (no other search needs to be implemented)

Part 2
------

In order to store this information, you should first create a user class that has the following attributes:

- Username
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone
- Major

The web application will add/update/delete/find students objects that are stored in a List that is in the MainPage.xaml.cs class.


Additional
----------

An alternative  to List  that you may use  is a Dictionary, but a simple  array is not recommended.
